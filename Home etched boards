An Attiny85 space invader game.
Board is produced using toner transfer method. 
I used 24mil wire trace with a ground fill isolation also of 24mil there are some thin traces circumventing the 
microprocessor these are 12mil
A silkscreen was then laid down after the etch and cleaning with acetone. Maybe I can use different colours on my silkscreen.
